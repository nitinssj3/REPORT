Traffic-Sign-Recognition-CNN
Overview
This is the implementation of Traffic Sign Recognition Project using deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. The model is trained, visualized and explored for better understanding of the pictorial data of traffic signs from natural images by using the Traffic Sign Dataset. Accuracy of model is upto 94% on test dataset.
